# Security + Moderation

See also: [acceptable-usage.md](./acceptable-usage.md) for the marketplace policy on prohibited skill categories.

## Roles + permissions

- user: upload skills/souls (subject to GitHub age gate), report skills/comments/packages.
- moderator: hide/restore skills, view hidden skills, unhide, soft-delete, ban users (except admins).
- admin: all moderator actions + hard delete skills, change owners, change roles.

## Reporting + auto-hide

- Reports are unique per user + target (skill/comment/package).
- Report reason required (trimmed, max 500 chars). Abuse of reporting may result in account bans.
- Per-user cap: 20 **active** reports.
  - Active skill report = skill exists, not soft-deleted, not `moderationStatus = removed`,
    and the owner is not banned.
  - Active comment report = comment exists, not soft-deleted, parent skill still active,
    and the comment author is not banned/deactivated.
  - Active package report = package exists, not soft-deleted, and the owner is
    not banned/deactivated.
- Auto-hide: when unique reports exceed 3 (4th report):
  - skill report flow:
    - soft-delete skill (`softDeletedAt`)
    - set `moderationStatus = hidden`
    - set `moderationReason = auto.reports`
    - set embeddings visibility `deleted`
    - audit log entry: `skill.auto_hide`
  - comment report flow:
    - soft-delete comment (`softDeletedAt`)
    - decrement comment stat via `uncomment` stat event
    - audit log entry: `comment.auto_hide`
- Package reports feed `clawhub-mod package moderation-queue` and audit `package.report`,
  but do not auto-hide or block downloads. Moderators can review a formal report
  with an explicit final action to quarantine or revoke the affected release.
- Package reports can be moved to `confirmed` or `dismissed` with a moderator
  note. Only `open` reports count toward `packages.reportCount` and user active
  report limits; confirming or dismissing a report decrements the open count.
- Skill reports now follow the same formal lifecycle: `open`, `confirmed`, or
  `dismissed`, with a single recorded `triageNote` used as the official outcome
  note. Moderators can review a formal report with an explicit final action to
  hide the affected skill. Skill report timelines are stored in
  `skillModerationEventLogs`.
- Package owners and publisher members can read package moderation status via
  API/CLI, including open report count, latest release moderation state, and
  download-block reasons. Reporter identities and report bodies remain moderator
  intake data.
- OpenClaw install clients can read the exact-release public trust endpoint at
  `GET /api/v1/packages/{name}/versions/{version}/security` without owner or
  moderator credentials. The endpoint returns only package identity, exact
  release artifact identifiers, and the install-consumable trust summary.
- `trust.blockedFromDownload` is the canonical install block signal for package
  releases. OpenClaw must use it instead of re-deriving blocking behavior from
  individual scan or moderation fields. `trust.reasons` is the compact user and
  audit explanation list, for example `manual:quarantined`, `scan:malicious`,
  `static:malicious`, or `package:malicious`; public trust responses must not
  expose open report counts.
- The legacy skill/package appeal tables and backend routes remain for
  compatibility, but the first-class CLI and docs surface is deprecated.
  Publisher recovery for false positives should use reports or out-of-band
  support, while account bans require out-of-band support.
- ClawScan `malicious` is the only automatic scanner verdict that hides,
  blocks installs, or schedules the account-level autoban/token-revocation
  workflow. Static scan and VirusTotal findings are telemetry and ClawScan
  inputs; they must not independently hide, block, or auto-ban.
- Pending skill ownership transfers must not be accepted when the requesting
  owner is deleted/deactivated or when the skill is malicious, hidden, or
  removed. The accept path is the final shared gate before ownership changes,
  so it must cancel the pending transfer before reporting the rejection.
- `clawScanNote` is optional publisher-authored context stored directly on a
  `skillVersions` or `packageReleases` row. It is not an appeal, has no
  accepted/rejected state, does not imply staff response, and must not drive
  moderation state transitions by itself.
- CLI publishes only include `clawScanNote` when the publisher explicitly passes
  it. UI publish flows may prefill the previous version/release note for
  convenience. Owners/admins can also update the latest version/release note
  from artifact settings and request a fresh ClawScan review without publishing
  a new version. ClawScan must treat the field as untrusted publisher-provided
  context rather than scanner instructions, and note updates must write an
  `auditLogs` entry.
- `auditLogs` remains the global compliance/security ledger. Product-facing
  moderation timelines live in `skillModerationEventLogs` and
  `packageModerationEventLogs`.
- Ownership-adjacent identity changes must also write `auditLogs`: user profile
  sync/update/ensure/delete, personal publisher create/sync, and org trusted
  publisher set/unset. Personal publisher sync should log meaningful create,
  change, link, or membership events, not routine login refreshes.
- Public queries hide non-active moderation statuses; moderators can still access via
  moderator-only queries and unhide/restore/delete/ban.
- Legacy report rows with `status: "triaged"` are read as `confirmed` for
  compatibility while new writes store `confirmed`.
- The legacy "Hide suspicious" browse/search filter and `isSuspicious` field
  are deprecated compatibility surfaces. Suspicious/review/warn guidance no
  longer creates an allowed-but-hidden product state.

## Skill moderation pipeline

- New skill publishes now persist a deterministic static scan result on the version.
- Static suspicious and malicious findings are advisory evidence and ClawScan
  inputs only. They do not hide or block an artifact unless ClawScan returns
  `malicious` or a manual moderation state applies.
- Public artifact pages present static analysis, VirusTotal malware telemetry,
  and ClawScan-powered risk review as one consolidated Security audit page.
  This is a product-facing model only; scanner storage, moderation decisions,
  and worker behavior remain separate internally.
- ClawScan verdicts come from a GitHub Actions Codex worker, not a single
  hosted LLM call. Publishes enqueue a scan job that waits at most 10 minutes
  for VirusTotal telemetry, then Codex reviews the materialized artifact
  workspace with static and VT signals as context.
- ClawScan writes the canonical scanner fields on skill versions and
  package/plugin releases:
  - `clawScanVerdict`: `clean | review | warn | malicious`
  - `clawScanState`: `pending | running | complete | error`
- `clawScanVerdict` is the source of truth for automatic scanner moderation and
  for the Security audit Outcome. `clean`, `review`, and `warn` remain
  visible/installable guidance states. Only `malicious` blocks visibility or
  install automatically.
- Manual moderation still wins over scanner results. A manually hidden,
  quarantined, revoked, removed, banned, or otherwise locked artifact must stay
  blocked even if ClawScan later returns `clean`.
- VirusTotal is telemetry only. It is included in the Codex workspace as signal,
  but VT alone must never hide, block, or set malicious/suspicious public status.
  The public Security audit UI may summarize vendor engine counts, including
  non-zero malicious or suspicious counts, but that display does not make VT a
  blocking verdict source.
- VirusTotal engine stats with zero malicious and zero suspicious detections and
  one or more undetected engines are resolved no-detections telemetry, not an
  in-progress scan. ClawHub should cache them as clean VT results instead of
  leaving public badges pending.
- All-active daily VirusTotal sweeps are disabled. Any future recurring VT
  freshness job must be bounded or delta-driven, and must not starve
  publish-triggered ClawScan jobs.
- Prompt-injection pre-scan hits are also context for Codex, not a deterministic
  post-Codex veto. The release worker must not downgrade a benign Codex verdict
  solely from regex telemetry.
- Pending/running/error ClawScan state is explicit in the UI and API but does
  not block visibility or install unless a manual moderation or unrelated
  availability gate also applies.
- Plugins under `@openclaw/*` owned by the OpenClaw publisher are trusted by
  default. They may still be audited, but scanner telemetry alone must not
  downgrade them.
- Operators can schedule targeted ClawScan rescans for skills and plugin
  releases without depending on legacy suspicious buckets.
- Package/plugin scan backfills now also recompute deterministic static scan results for older releases,
  so legacy plugin versions can surface OpenClaw scan findings without republishing.
- ClawPack package releases keep static/LLM scan inputs intentionally metadata-only for now:
  `package.json`, `openclaw.plugin.json`, package/source metadata, and release facts. VirusTotal
  scans the exact uploaded `.tgz`; ClawHub does not currently run deep static/LLM scans across every
  tarball file.
- Packages cache VirusTotal undetected-only engine results as clean VT telemetry.
  ClawHub does not request or consume VirusTotal AI/code-insight results; VT is
  engine/vendor telemetry only.
- Skill moderation state stores a structured snapshot:
  - `moderationVerdict`: `clean | malicious` for scanner-managed decisions
  - `moderationReasonCodes[]`: canonical machine-readable reasons
  - `moderationEvidence[]`: capped file/line evidence for static findings
  - `moderationSummary`, engine version, evaluation timestamp, source version id
- Structured moderation is rebuilt from current signals instead of appending stale scanner codes.
- Legacy moderation flags remain only during migration compatibility and should
  not be used as product logic for review/warn guidance. `blocked.malware`
  remains the legacy compatibility flag for hidden/blocked malicious state.
- Operators can force-rebuild skill moderation from the latest version to clear stale aggregate rows
  after ClawScan policy changes. Conservative cleanup may soft-hide exact test/placeholder
  suspicious skills, but broad duplicate-looking families require separate human review.
- Static scan evidence must identify a concrete risky source/sink, not just adjacent primitives:
  - declared provider credentials and declared provider base URLs are not credential-harvest findings by themselves.
  - user-directed provider uploads are not exfiltration unless the source is broad/private/sensitive, automatic, or sent to an unrelated/hidden destination.
  - Basic Auth/base64 credential encoding and provider-response base64 decoding are normal integration behavior.
  - scoped uninstall cleanup under a skill-owned `.openclaw` path is not a destructive-delete finding unless it deletes a broad/protected path or hides impact.
  - stealth/anti-detection browser automation becomes malicious only when paired with bot-protection bypass and persistent sessions.
- Static malware detection now hard-blocks install prompts that tell users to paste obfuscated shell payloads
  (for example base64-decoded `curl|bash` terminal commands). When triggered:
  - the uploaded skill is hidden immediately
  - the uploader is placed into manual moderation
  - all owned skills are hidden until moderator review

## AI comment scam backfill

- Moderators/admins can run a comment backfill scanner to classify scam comments with OpenAI.
- Scanner stores per-comment moderation metadata:
  - `scamScanVerdict`: `not_scam | likely_scam | certain_scam`
  - `scamScanConfidence`: `low | medium | high`
  - explanation/evidence/model/check timestamp fields on `comments`.
- Auto-ban trigger is intentionally strict:
  - only `certain_scam` with `high` confidence can trigger account ban.
  - moderator/admin accounts are never auto-banned by this pipeline.
- Ban reason is bounded to 500 chars and includes concise evidence + comment/skill IDs.
- CLI run examples:
  - one-shot: `npx convex run commentModeration:backfillCommentScamModeration '{"batchSize":25,"maxBatches":20}'`
  - background chain: `npx convex run commentModeration:scheduleCommentScamModeration '{"batchSize":25}'`

## Bans

- Banning a user:
  - hard-deletes all owned skills
  - soft-deletes all authored skill comments + soul comments
  - revokes API tokens
  - sets `deletedAt` on the user
- Admins can manually unban (`deletedAt` + `banReason` cleared); revoked API tokens
  stay revoked and should be recreated by the user.
- Optional ban reason is stored in `users.banReason` and audit logs.
- Admins can reclassify an existing ban reason without unbanning or restoring
  content. This preserves the ban while removing users from remediation flows
  that key off a specific historical reason such as `malware auto-ban`.
- Moderators cannot ban admins; nobody can ban themselves.
- Report counters effectively reset because deleted/banned skills are no longer
  considered active in the per-user report cap.

## User account deletion

- User-initiated deletion is irreversible.
- Deletion flow:
  - sets `deactivatedAt` + `purgedAt`
  - revokes API tokens
  - clears profile/contact fields
  - clears telemetry
- Deleted accounts cannot be restored by logging in again.
- Published skills remain public.

## Upload gate (GitHub account age)

- Skill + soul publish actions require GitHub account age ≥ 14 days.
- Skill + soul comment creation also requires GitHub account age ≥ 14 days.
- Lookup uses GitHub `created_at` fetched by the immutable GitHub numeric ID (`providerAccountId`)
  and caches on the user:
  - `githubCreatedAt` (source of truth)
- Gate applies to web uploads, CLI publish, GitHub import, and comments.
- If GitHub responds `403` or `429`, publish fails with:
  - `GitHub API rate limit exceeded — please try again in a few minutes`
- To reduce rate-limit failures, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Convex env for authenticated
  GitHub API requests. The same token is used for trusted-publisher repository
  identity lookups.

## Empty-skill cleanup (backfill)

- Cleanup uses quality heuristics plus trust tier to identify very thin/templated
  skills.
- Word counting is language-aware (`Intl.Segmenter` with fallback), reducing
  false positives for non-space-separated languages.
